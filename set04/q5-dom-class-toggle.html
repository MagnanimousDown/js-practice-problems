<!-- Problem:
Create a webpage with:
<p id="modeText">Light Mode</p>
Using JavaScript:
Add a button: "Toggle Mode"
When clicked:
If text is “Light Mode”, change to “Dark Mode” and set background color to black, text to white
If text is “Dark Mode”, change to “Light Mode” and reset to white background, black text
✅ You can use document.body.style, textContent, and basic conditionals.
📌 No need for events or listeners, you can call the function directly from inline HTML if needed for now. -->
