# JavaScript Practice Problems

A collection of JavaScript practice sets based on my learning journey from **Chai aur Code**.

## Sets

- ✅ Set 01 – Conditionals, loops, object props, DOM basics
- ✅ Set 02 – Array methods, filtering, DOM querying
- ✅ Set 03 – String & array logic, DOM replace, reduce
- ✅ Set 04 – `Set`, `split()` and `join()`, Toggling object properties, DOM manipulation and a little of Event handling

## My Progress

Started learning JavaScript on **12th July 2025**. These exercises help me solidify core concepts before diving deeper into MERN stack.
